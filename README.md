# Smart-Alert-App-for-dangerous-incident
This was a project created during my university's course "CURRENT TOPICS OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING -SOFTWARE FOR MOBILE DEVICES" Language: Java (in Android studio)

This is an android  app where users can report dangerous incidents. <br>
If an incident has been reported by users in a nearby area, the reports are combined in a signe report.<br>
Firebase has been used as an online database.<br><br>

Admin users can view incidents and accept them or reject the reports.<br>
Incidents that have been reported by more people appear higher in the list.<br>

Once admins accept a report, a notification is sent to users that are nearby.
